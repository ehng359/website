Ruminating in that sentiment, now as a 4th year, I wanted to demonstrate that I have grown from that mentality, and the existence and steady progress for developing the content and the information surrounding my life, professionally, is a testament to that particular growth. In essence, this is my magnum opus (so far). ",

Things like what I've thought, what do I think and what I will think is something I plan to encapsulate with these very pages. Also, I have the spontaneous drive of creating random components from pure JS and this place acts as an amazing center to showcase those things (and perhaps make them publicly available packages).",

The ideation for translating the particular actions to use for navigation and the overall design of which actions to select definitely took the most time, followed very closely wiht the actual implementation (drag-to-do-anything is a serious pain, especially given constraints).",
                "With respect to the actual terminal-based navigation, I opted for intuitive user experience, utilizing the commands `ls`, `cd` and `cat` as the primary tools to traverse the file system and access the articles (just like this one!). For those less terminal-savy, I also (currently) opted to design a desktop using folders and an actual file-system to access the same information. In all honesty, I believe that it creates the best of both worlds."
